# SWR_PROGRAM_CREATE
To automate SWR program creation, generated based on bom programs. Developed by [jiajunlee](https://github.com/jiajunlee19).

<br>

There are generally 3 types of SWR, see limitations in below section.
1. `SWR Part Extra Place` or `Adding Part` (Low demand - ~10%)
2. `SWR Part No Place` or `Removing Part` (Low demand - ~10%)
3. `SWR Part Number/Suffix Sub` or `Subbing Part` (High demand ~80%)

<br>

### How to run?
0. (Optional) Go to `settings` sheet in [BOM.xlsx](BOM.xlsx), modify the settings if needed.
1. Go to `SWR` sheet in [SWR.xlsx](SWR.xlsx), fill in all SWR requirements accordingly.
2. Place all relevant bom recipes in [recipe-bom](recipe-bom/) folder.
3. Run [main.exe](main.exe).
4. Created SWR recipes can be found in [recipe-swr](recipe-swr/) folder within subfolder grouped by `CBID`.
5. (Optional): View the logs in [Log/SWR_PROGRAM_CREATE.log](Log/SWR_PROGRAM_CREATE.log).

<br>

### Limitations
Below are the limitations that cannot be handled. Warning will be raised as such the impacted CBID will be skipped.
1. `SWR Part Extra Place` or `Adding Part` cannot be handled.
2. `SWR Part Sub` or `Subbing Part` with feeder used in any non-impacted designator cannot be handled.

<br>

### Test Cases
Below are the passing test cases, using master bom recipes in [recipe-bom/590-123456/](recipe-bom/590-123456/).

| [123459-PARTSUB-ALL](SWR.xlsx)       | [All impated parts and feeders are subbed](recipe-swr/123459-PARTSUB-ALL/)     |
| [123460-PARTSUB-PARTIAL](SWR.xlsx)   | No SWR recipes generated as per limitation `#2`                                |
